        <h2>About Alex Goldstein</h2>
        <img src="images/about1.jpeg" alt="Alex working with her camera" class="about-photo">

        <p>Alex has always been a storyteller—whether through the written word as an attorney or through the timeless beauty of film photography. 
        A <strong>proud Texas girly</strong>, Alex was born and raised in the Lone Star State, where her love for capturing moments began with a special gift: 
        her grandfather’s <strong>Canon T50</strong>. That camera, rich with history and family memories, became her creative outlet in high school, where she first 
        experienced the magic of film photography and developing prints in the darkroom.</p>

        <p>Alex went on to attend <strong>Trinity University in San Antonio</strong>, proudly embracing her Texas roots while pursuing higher education. But life had new 
        adventures in store—her path led her to <strong>Colorado</strong>, where she attended law school at the <strong>University of Denver</strong>. In the heart of the Rockies, 
        she built a new home, fell in love with the breathtaking landscapes, and met her husband, a Colorado native.</p>

        <p>It was during a visit home to Texas for the holidays that Alex rediscovered her passion. Tucked away, waiting for her, was her <strong>Grandpa’s old Canon T50</strong>. 
        She decided to bring it back to Colorado, unknowingly reigniting the creative spark that had been waiting to be rekindled. What started as a personal rediscovery 
        soon evolved into a deep and consuming love for the art of film photography.</p>

        <p>Recognizing her talent and passion, Alex’s family encouraged her journey by gifting her a <strong>darkroom intensive course at the Colorado Photographic Arts Center</strong>. 
        There, under the guidance of expert photographers, she refined her skills in developing and printing film, mastering the process that had first inspired her years before.</p>

        <p>Today, Alex is building a stunning portfolio of film photography—capturing <strong>joy, emotion, and unforgettable moments</strong> through the <strong>dying art of film photography</strong>. 
        As an attorney, Alex has always been passionate about working with people. As a photographer, she uses that same passion to connect with those she photographs, preserving their most 
        <strong>magical, fleeting moments</strong> with warmth, artistry, and authenticity.</p>

        <p>She would love to work with you to capture your story—one timeless frame at a time.</p>
