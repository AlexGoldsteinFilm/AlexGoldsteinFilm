        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Do you charge for transportation?</h3>
        <p>I don't charge for travel within Denver. However, I do add a travel charge for shoots outside of Denver. Please reach out to discuss your desired shoot location so I can provide a cost breakdown.</p>
        
        <h3>You use film, what happens if something goes wrong with the film?</h3>
        <p>With film, you capture a quality you can't get naturally with digital. However, to achieve that, you rely on light control and chemical processing. Likewise, we don't get the instant gratification of digital photography. If we are not happy with the quality of the photos or anything goes wrong with the film development process, we will redo the shoot free of charge.</p>
